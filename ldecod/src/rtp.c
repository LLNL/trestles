  A quick guide to the basics of the RTP decoder implementation

  This module contains the RTP packetization, de-packetization, and the
  handling of Parameter Sets, see VCEG-N52 and accompanying documents.
  Note: Compound packets are not yet implemented!

  The interface between every NAL (including the RTP NAL) and the VCL is
  based on Slices.  The slice data structure on which the VCL is working
  is defined in the type Slice (in defines.h).  This type contains the
  various fields of the slice header and a partition array, which itself
  contains the data partitions the slice consists of.  When data
  partitioning is not used, then the whole slice bit string is stored
  in partition #0.  When individual partitions are missing, this is
  indicated by the size of the bit strings in the partition array.
  A complete missing slice (e.g. if a Full Slice packet was lost) is
  indicated in a similar way.

  part of the slice structure is the error indication (ei-flag).  The
  Ei-flag is set in such cases in which at least one partition of a slice
  is damaged or missing.When data partitioning is used, it can happen that
  one partition does not contain any symbols but the ei_flag is cleared,
  which indicates the intentional missing of symbols of that partition.
  A typical example for this behaviour is the Intra Slice, which does not
  have symnbols in its type C partition.

  The VCL requests new data to work on through the call of readSliceRTP().
  This function calls the main state machine of this module in ReadRTPpaacket().

  ReadRTPpacket assumes, when called, that in an error free environment
  a complete slice, consisting of one Full Slice RTP packet, or three Partition
  packets of types A, B, C with consecutive sequence numbers, can be read.
  It first interprets any trailing SUPP and Parameter Update (Header) packets.
  Then it reads one video data packet.  Two cases have to be distinguished:

  1. Type A, or Full Slice packet
  In this case, the PictureID and the macroblock mumbers are used to
  identify the potential loss of a slice.  A slice is lost, when the
  StartMB of the newly read slice header is not equal to the current
  state of the decoder
    1.1 Loss detected
      In this case the last packet is unread (fseek back), and a dummy slice
      containing the missing macroblocks is conveyed to the VCL.  At the next
      call of the NAL, the same packet is read again, but this time no packet
      loss is detected by the above algorithm,
    1.2. No loss
      In this case it is checked whether a Full Slice packet or a type A data
      partition was read
        1.2.1 Full Slice
          The Full Slice packet is conveyed to the NAL
        1.2.2 Type A Partition
          The function RTPReadDataPartitionedSlice() is called, which collects
          the remaining type B, C partitions and handles them appropriately.

  Paraneter Update Packets (aka Header packets) are in an SDP-like syntax
  and are interpreted by a simple parser in the function
  RTPInterpretParameterSetPacket()

  Each Slice header contaions the information on which parameter set to be used.
  The function RTPSetImgInp() copies the information of the relevant parameter
  set in the VCL's global variables p_Vid-> and p_Inp->  IMPORTANT: any changes
  in the semantics of the p_Vid-> and p_Inp-> structure members must be represented
  in this function as well!

  A note to the stream-buffer data structure: The stream buffer always contains
  only the contents of the partition in question, and not the slice/partition
  header.  Decoding has to start at bitoffset 0 (CAVLC) or bytreoffset 0 (CABAC).

  The remaining functions should be self-explanatory.
